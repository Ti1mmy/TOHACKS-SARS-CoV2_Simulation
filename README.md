# TOHACKS-SARS-COV2_MODEL
Quick simulation we programmed for the TOHacks hackathon.

Allows user to specify certain conditions (ex. number of people in simulation) and run a simulation showing the transfer of the Covid-19 virus. Not 100% accurate but works to show how the virus transfers between people. 

Quick demo showing our project:
